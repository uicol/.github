# uicol

`uicol` is a UI protocol and a markup[^1] for mobile apps (iOS/Android) to make
server-driven screens or even whole apps. Rather than relying on a standard set
of low-level set of tags like HTML does, it is tailored for custom-made
higher-level components, like a gallery section, or a product price section, or
a product description section.

In the first place it's suited for pages like landings, or a complex product
pages, or any page heavily controlled by a server â€” where lots of decisions has
to be made on what to show and in what order. `uicol` really fits well when you
want your clients (iOS, Android and Web) to be synchronized in what is shown to
a user.

`uicol` is also a set of libraries made with a native technology for each
platform, so it is fast and simple to connect and use. There are no weird
complex issues to make your build complex and slow (like React Native), there
are no compatibility issues.
